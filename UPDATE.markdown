1.0.0 to 1.1.0

 * `Resources/Thread/comment.html.twig` has changed, adding a rawBody option. This change is not relevant unless you are going to use RawComments

0.9.2 to 1.0.0

 * You need to remove comment.js previously used by this bundle. async.html.twig now includes its
   own javascript file automatically.
 * There is now a dependency on FOSRestBundle. Check the installation documentation for details.
 * Routing has changed, you must replace your existing fos_comment route import to

   ``` yaml
   fos_comment_api:
       type: rest
       resource: "@FOSCommentBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"
       prefix: /comment/api
   ```

 * The way to include comments in a page has changed, importing an asynchronous javascript template into
   your page which will trigger an asynchronous load of a comment thread using the REST api.

   ``` jinja
   {% include 'FOSCommentBundle:Thread:async.html.twig' with {'id': 'foo'} %}
   ```

   methods to save*().
